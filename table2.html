            Intro:
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            We are a society, that for all intents and purposes, does not exist.
            Our sole purpose is to research social media and discover one essential question: 
            Is social media a computing innovation... or not?
    
        </p>
    
        <h2>
            What is social media?
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            A social media platform is an online digital service or website that allows people to share and create content. For example, Facebook and Instagram are social media platforms because they allow users to communicate and connect with each other online. It is a public place for people to interact with each other through posts and messages.
        </p>
    
        <h2>
            Does it include a program?
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            <b>Yes, a social media platform does include a program.</b> In fact, they include code from various coding languages, such as HTML, Python, JavaScript, and more! This code handles the user interface, data management of the user, communication, security, and performance. It is used to store information in databases, while also keeping information safe and secure. Overall, the code is extremely important, and there are numerous programs that help make social media efficient and effective.
    
        </p>
    
        <h2>
            Is it easy to tell what the code does?
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            Social media is an international platform that connects its users using an algorithm and suggests other connections based on specific factors. Overall, <b>while it is difficult to understand</b> exactly how the program recommends different people and content to connect with a user, <b>on a basic level, the purpose of the program is clearly defined.</b> 
        </p>
    
        <h2>
            Is social media a physical or nonphysical concept?
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            Social media is a <b>nonphysical concept</b> as it refers to a variety of technologies which facilitate the sharing of information and ideas amongst users throughout the platform and the internet. These platforms initiate interactions without needing a physical presence, therefore proving social media to be a nonphysical concept. 
    
        </p>
    
    
        <h2>
            Does Social Media exist or is it theoretical?
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            Even though social media platforms are non physical, they hold a massive online presence as over 5 billion people use it. Social media connects people and allows them to share content and bond in a community.  As a result, social media not only exists, but has a real effect on its users, for better or worse.
        </p>
    
        <h2>
            RESULT: Is social media a computing innovation?
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            After careful consideration of the given data, we are able to conclude that a social media platform is <b>not a computing innovation</b> given that the infrastructure that it was built upon was already existing and connections between computers existed before the invention of the innovation.
